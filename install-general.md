# <a id='installing'></a> Installing Part I: Prerequisites, Cluster Configurations, EULA, and CLI

This document describes the first part of the installation process for Tanzu Application Platform:

+ [Prerequisites](#prereqs)
+ [Set and Verify the Kubernetes Cluster Configurations](#set-and-verify)
+ [Accept the EULAs](#eulas)
+ [Install the Tanzu CLI and Package Plugin](#cli-and-plugin)


## <a id='prereqs'></a>Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required to install Tanzu Application Platform:

* A [TanzuNet](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/) account to download TAP packages.

* A container image registry, such as [Harbor](https://goharbor.io/) or [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) with at least **10 GB** of available storage for application images, base images, and runtime dependencies. Registry credentials with push/write access must be made available to TAP to store images. Note that registry credentials are required for components that pull/read public images from Docker Hub, in order to avoid rate limiting.

* Network access to https://registry.tanzu.vmware.com as well as your chosen container image registry.

* A Kubernetes cluster (v1.19 or later) on one of the following Kubernetes providers:

    * Azure Kubernetes Service
    * Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service
    * kind
      
        If you are using Cloud Native Runtimes, see [Configure Your Local Kind
        Cluster](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Cloud-Native-Runtimes-for-VMware-Tanzu/1.0/tanzu-cloud-native-runtimes-1-0/GUID-local-dns.html#configure-your-local-kind-cluster-1)
        in the Cloud Native Runtimes documentation to configure kind.

    * Google Kubernetes Engine (note that GKE Autopilot clusters do not have required features enabled)
    * minikube

  To deploy all TAP packages, your cluster must have at least **8 GB** of RAM across all nodes available to TAP.
  However, we recommend at least **16 GB** of RAM be available to build and deploy applications.
  
  For a single node cluster, such as KIND, we recommend **4 vCPU** be available, along with **70 GB** disk.
  
  For this beta release, [Pod Security Policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/) must be configured so that TAP controller pods may run as root.
  
* **The Kubernetes CLI, kubectl, v1.19** or later, installed and authenticated with administrator rights for your target cluster.

* **[kapp Carvel command line tool](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/carvel-kapp/releases)** (v0.37.0 or later)

* kapp-controller v0.24.0 or later:

    * For Azure Kubernetes Service, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, Google Kubernetes Engine, kind, and minikube,
      Install kapp-controller by running:
      ```
      kapp deploy -a kc -f https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/carvel-kapp-controller/releases/download/KC-VERSION/release.yml
      ```
      Where `KC-VERSION` is the kapp-controller version being installed. Please select v0.24.0+ kapp-controller version from the [Releases page](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/carvel-kapp-controller/releases).

      For example:
      ```

        -f https://github.com/fluxcd/source-controller/releases/download/v0.15.4/source-controller.deployment.yaml
        ```




## <a id='set-and-verify'></a> Set and Verify the Kubernetes Cluster Configurations

To set and verify the Kubernetes cluster configurations:

1. List the existing contexts by running:

    ```
    kubectl config get-contexts
    ```
    For example:
    ```
    $ kubectl config get-contexts
    CURRENT   NAME                                CLUSTER           AUTHINFO                                NAMESPACE
              aks-repo-trial                      aks-repo-trial    clusterUser_aks-rg-01_aks-repo-trial
    *         aks-tap-cluster                     aks-tap-cluster   clusterUser_aks-rg-01_aks-tap-cluster
              tkg-mgmt-vc-admin@tkg-mgmt-vc       tkg-mgmt-vc       tkg-mgmt-vc-admin
              tkg-vc-antrea-admin@tkg-vc-antrea   tkg-vc-antrea     tkg-vc-antrea-admin
    ```

2.  Set the context to the cluster that you want to use for the TAP packages install.
    For example set the context to the `aks-tap-cluster` context by running:

    ```
    kubectl config use-context aks-tap-cluster
    ```
    For example:
    ```
    $ kubectl config use-context aks-tap-cluster
    Switched to context "aks-tap-cluster".
    ```

3. Verify kapp-controller is running by running:
   ```
   kubectl get pods -A | grep kapp-controller
   ```
   Pod status should be Running.

4. Verify secretgen-controller is running by running:
   ```
   kubectl get pods -A | grep secretgen-controller
   ```
   Pod status should be Running.

## Install the Tanzu CLI Plugins

After you have installed the tanzu core executable, you must install package, imagepullsecret, apps and app-accelerator CLI plugins.

1. Navigate to the tanzu folder that contains the cli folder.

2. Run the following command from the tanzu directory to install all the plugins for this release.
    ```
    tanzu plugin install --local cli all
    ```
3. Check plugin installation status.
    ```
    tanzu plugin list
    ```
    The versions should mostly reflect the downloaded file version numbers (not all plugins are going to match the exact same download version - i.e. `v0.5.0` below). For example:
    ```
    tanzu plugin list

    ```
  
**A note regarding the installed plugins:**
The `package`, `imgpullsecret`, `accelerator`, and `apps` plugins will be used to install and/or interact with the Tanzu Application Platform.
   
The installation of this beta product requires cluster-admin privileges. There are additional plugin/commands included with the Tanzu CLI which could have unintended side-effects. For the purposes of installing this beta, VMware recommends against running commands for the following CLI plugins: `cluster`, `kubernetes-release`, `login`, `management-cluster`, and `pinniped-auth`.
